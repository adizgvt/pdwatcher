for uploading modified file

local db store id, local_path, remote_id, remote_timestamp, local_modified

call API to get remote Id last remote_timstamp;

^-----maybe just -> rename file, add new entry add server


for downloading files

query all files from local db with existing remote_id

call API check all user files/folders

#divide into two task -> UpdateExistingFiles() DownloadNewFiles()

iterate through all files/folders

id not exist in local db: consider as new file. add to DownloadNewFiles()

if id exist.
filter out where localDB.remote_timestamp = API.remote_timestamp;

if localDB.remote_timestamp == API.remote_timestamp::
    remote same

    ignore

if localDB.remote_timestamp != API.remote_timestamp::

    remote modified
    download file from server to temp,

    localDB.local_modified:
        copy local file to temp -> rename -> move to original directory

    move downloaded file from temp to original directory using original name to replace the local file;




                                #LOCAL OPERATION
                                #prepare event processor to skip generated event;
